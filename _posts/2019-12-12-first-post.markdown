Here it is. The first blog post. I'll use this post to break down the fourth wall and capture some thoughts.

I want this blog to be a good source of memoized knowledge, solutions (and their problems), and maybe some insight I deem worthy of being shared. I don't consider myself to be a very good writer, so that's likely not going to be an attractive trait or hopeful goal of the site.

I'll do my best to try and keep blog posts somewhat narrowly focused. Otherwise, I risk writing too much content, or introducing too many moving parts, making the post less effective. It'll be a fun balance to learn I think. The more I use the blog, the more hindsight should show me the way. I hope.

Stay tuned, I plan on the first "real" post featuring my journey of setting up this blog with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and (re-)learning about DNS.

Unrelated:

The code snippets are definitely cool. I'm certainly going to post some code. The example first post from Jekyll uses code block syntax with curly braces and percent signs, which I haven't seen before. The following are two blocks using backticks and the crazy percent signs with mustaches, which look to be the same.

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I'll stick with backticks.
