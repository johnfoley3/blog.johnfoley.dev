# Blog

My blog repo served via Github Pages.

## Setup

System technologies:
- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage Ruby. Reads version listed in [.ruby-version](./.ruby-version).
- `bundler` comes for free with `ruby v2.6.5`

## Development

Run `make serve` to install gems and spin up a local server to view the blog.

## Future goals

- Containerize this repo to simplify local setup
